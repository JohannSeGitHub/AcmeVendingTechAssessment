# Tech Used
.NetCore 3.1

# Brief Description
I made the decision to use .netCore since it offers users the option to deploy to Windows, Linux and MacOS. The idea being that a vending machine can be depllyed to a linux box or Raspberry Pi making the cost of the device much cheaper. 

Also I think .netCore is fantastic and enjoy using and learning.

The application is a Console app that offers some basic choices to a user and then process input via a business logic Assembly that can be reused in different projects

The project is very much a start and the calcuations for providing change to a customer is not yet implimeted
